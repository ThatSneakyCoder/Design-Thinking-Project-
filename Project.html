		<h1>What we do</h1>
		<p>We have taken various steps to solve the problem, starting by identifying the smaller issue first and using the Design Thinking Process to do things step by step.</p>

				<h3>Step 1: Identifying the market or area which faces this problem</h3>
				<p>Population density refers to the number of people living in a particular area, usually expressed as the number of individuals per square kilometer. High population density areas have a large number of people living in a relatively small space, which can increase the risk of certain hazards. Here are some examples of places with very high population density and their associated hazards:</p>
					<li>Urban Slums: Urban slums are characterized by poor living conditions, overcrowding, and inadequate access to basic services. They are at high risk of disasters such as Fire hazards.</li>
					<li>Cities: Cities are often the most densely populated areas on earth. Cities have numerous issues such as congested housing, poor cable management and constant construction due to this they also have a higher risk of disasters such as Fire Hazards.</li>

				<h3>Step 2: Surveying the population of these areas</h3>
				<p>We have talked to a few people who live in these areas and here is what they had to say about Fire Hazards</p>
